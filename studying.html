  <h2> Getting Started</h2> 
  <br>
  <h4> How do I get started in my assigned/interested event? </h4>
  <p class="smalltext"> Go to the SciOly Wiki Page of your event. Take notes of what you have read about. Understand the diagrams and their significance. Tests may have you label a similar diagram. If you don't understand a concept on the Wiki, take a note and look further into it. Attempt to understand everything on the Wiki, but take the information with a grain of salt.</p>
  <h4> How should I research and learn information beyond the SciOly Wiki?</h4>
  <p class="smalltext"> The SciOly Wiki is a very basic introduction to your event. When you feel like you are ready to move on with more advanced information, it is time to search more resources, based on the information you learned on the Wiki. Google Search a term you find important in the event. This process 
 is a self-learning process, and it may take weeks, even months, for you to get the hang of it. However, the outcome of this process is valuable- you won't need to rely on anyone to find great resources. 
  <br><br>For example, if an unfamiliar term you learned on the SciOly Wiki is "Quark", you may want to do a quick Google Search to research mainly a simple and comprehensive definition of the term, and research related concepts to the word (ex: Quark). Take notes on what you have gathered on the vocab word or concept. These notes are used for you to review, <b>not</b> used for your binder/notesheet.<br><br>Following this process of studying each week will allow improvement to be seen.  </p> 
  <br><br>
  <h2>Partners</h2>
  <p class="smalltext">Each member will be assigned a partner after teams are selected. We expect partners to regularly meet and study with each other, as in a study session or a mock-test.</p>
  <h4> What do I do when meeting my partner(s)?</h4>
  <p class="smalltext">It is recommended to have partners take practice tests together. Practice tests can be found <a href="practicetests.html">here</a>. Members are also recommended to spend partner-meeting times by sharing what they have researched and learned through self-studying times.</p>
